**Installation**		

1. Clone the repository to your ~/ folder. We will change the permissions since root will be handling your motd when you login.
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/Heisenberg-UP/personalized-motd
cd personalized-motd && sudo chmod 755 * && sudo chown root:root
```
2. Make a copy of the original motd scripts provided by Ubuntu for safe keeping. We will change the permissions so the original scripts are no longer executable.
```bash
mkdir original-motd && chmod 700 original-motd/
sudo cp /etc/update-motd.d/* ~/personalized-motd/original-motd/ && sudo chmod 644 ~/personalized-motd/original-motd/*
sudo rm /etc/update-motd.d/*
```
3. Symbolically link personalized scripts to the root motd folder.
```bash
cd /etc/update-motd.d/
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/00-header
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/10-help-text
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/50-custom-landscape
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/97-overlay-services
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/98-updates-available
sudo ln -s ~/personalized-motd/99-reboot-required
```
4.a) Edit the 00-header file to print your server name. Change HomeLab to whatever you want. Look for the line:
```bash
text="HomeLab" # Server name
```
5.a) Edit the 97-overlay-services file to check for the status of your services, and then print those services along with their status. To accomplish this you need to alter the variables to look up the services you are hosting or monitoring.
```bash
SAMBA="$(sudo systemctl status smbd | awk '/Active:/ {print $2}')" # Find out service status
samba=$(print_status $SAMBA)
```
5.b) You will also need to change the echo commands to print your correct service name in the 97-overlay-service file.
```bash
echo "\033[1;35m*\033[0m \033[1;32mSamba\033[0m:\t\t$samba" # Samba service
```
6. Once you have personalized your files to print the correct server name and show your desired services, you can test it by logging in and out of the server or by running:
```bash
sudo run-parts /etc/update-motd.d/
```
